# shopify-challenge
My name is Padma Iyengar, and I am applying for the Data Science Intern position at Shopify for Winter 2021. I have completed the challenges offered by Shopify. 

Question 1 was completed using Python, and has been uploaded as a Jupyter Notebook. 
Question 2 was completed using SQL, and has been uploaded as a PDF. The queries can be copied as needed. 
In both questions, I provided my final answers along with my thought process.

Thank you for your time and for the opportunity to apply.
