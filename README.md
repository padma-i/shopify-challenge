# shopify-challenge
My name is Padma Iyengar, and I am applying for the Data Science Intern position at Shopify for Winter 2021. I have completed the challenges from Shopify. 

- Question 1 was completed using Python, and has been uploaded as a Jupyter Notebook. 
- Question 2 was completed using SQL, and has two uploads. The file "Question2" has both my answers and steps as a PDF (for readability). The file "Question2-Answers-Only" is a text file with only my final queries and outputs (allows for queries to be copied and run in a separate window).

In both questions, I provided my final answers along with my thought process. 

Thank you for your time, consideration, and for the opportunity to apply!
